# Installation

# App guide
- App fetches betting array based on decimal odds through dropdown filtration.
- Lists all the betting options with input field for stake.
- Once number is entered, stake button needs to be pressed to enable Receipt Modal.
- If input value with the same betId is detected, it updates the receipt.
- Apology if i have driven the project in separate guidelines than what have been expected.

# Things could be improved
   #  Styling
- Design prospective, photoshop tools was missing(my license expired as my previous work ended). It would have made significant changes in UI
- Sass could be used to make styling more friendly.
- Font selection would be more generic using photoshop design wireframes
- Fonts, colors and spacings could be customized in mobile screen view.
   #  Development
- More validations could have been added with bet limit, empty stakes, betamount display in null or 0 input
- Backend API filtration could have been more realistic.
- Functions, Components and API could have been separated making clean modules.
- Packages like linting could have been added to follow common approach.
- TDD approach should have been implemented specially for API fetch.
  (As discussed in initial interview as well, TDD is in good rise these days and my first todolist is to get good understanding of it. I know how it works and have ran through it but haven't done much tests in it.)

# Summary
I managed to work in this task within my break hours and evening.
Thus, apologize for not being able to focus for long in all improvements.
If given chance, i really wish to make improvements and deliver all i could within the team for the growth of business.
